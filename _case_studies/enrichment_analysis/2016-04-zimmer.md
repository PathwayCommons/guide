## Context
Atherosclerosis is commonly referred to as 'hardening' of the arteries and represents the underlying pathology that causes heart attacks, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease that results in progressive narrowing of the arterial vessels due to imbalances in lipid metabolism. Ultimately, such lesions can limit the flow of oxygen-rich blood to organs.

Cholesterol is a key molecule pathogenesis: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the blood promotes cholesterol accumulation and an innate inflammatory response in the arterial wall which drives atherosclerosis. Lipid and the cholesterol crystal (CC) deposition on the subendothelial wall can stimulate macrophages and potentiate an innate immune response (Guo 2015). To counteract this, intracellular mechanisms exist to either modify cholesterol into an inert form or promote efflux from cholesterol-loaded macrophages.

  <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Involvement of cholesterol and lipoproteins in atherosclerosis. Depicted is an example of an artery showing the progression of atherosclerosis. The process consists of deposition of cholesterol in the artery wall (by LDL), oxidation of LDL, inflammation (mediated by IL-6 and CRP), attraction of monocytes and/or macrophages and the development of plaques. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, which occurs in most people. Whether or not it results in an actual clinical manifestation of acute coronary events depends on the development of unstable plaques with a thin fibrous cap separating the lipid pool from the blood flow. Rupture of the plaques can lead to thrombosis. HDL size depends on the cholesterol concentration and ApoA-I is the major apolipoprotein of HDL. HDL can take up small amounts of cholesterol from macrophages for transport back to the liver (reverse cholesterol transport), but this process depends on HDL functionality. Abbreviations: ApoA-I, apolipoprotein A-I; ApoB, apolipoprotein B; CETP, cholesteryl ester transfer protein; CRP, C-reactive protein; Lp(a), lipoprotein(a); OxPL, oxidized phospholipids.

Pharmacologic intervention that target LDL reduction is amongst the most successful therapeutic approaches. Nevertheless, there are many instances when LDL reduction is not possible.

## Question
Can pharmacological increase of cholesterol solubility, clearance and catabolism be exploited to prevent and treat atherosclerosis *in vivo*?

## Goals

Previously, genetic approaches to increase the ability of macrophages to remove free cholesterol from atherosclerotic lesions have been proven successful. Likewise, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agent *2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin* (CD), has been shown to increase cholesterol solubility, remove it from macrophages (foam cells) and reduce immune responses *in vitro* (//TODO - Ref). Mechanisms?

Zimmer et al. (Zimmer 2016) use mouse models of atherosclerosis to test the effectiveness of CD *in vivo*. In order to investigate the mechanistic basis of the effect of CD, they perform a genome-wide expression screen of biopsies of human atherosclerotic plaques treated with CD.
