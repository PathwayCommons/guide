## Quick Summary
* GITR

## Author Profile
YuHan Chang and Tania Watts are in the Department of Immunology at the University of Toronto.

## Context



LCMV infection of its natural host, *Mus Musculus*, has served as the prototypic system to explore host-virus interactions and identify key determinants of viral clearance or persistence (Ng et al. 2013). In particular, the Clone 13 (Cl-13) variant replicates to high-titers, inducing mulitiple host-suppressive pathways and elicits a persistent infection last up to 90 days. Importantly, the immune events triggered by Cl-13 are similar to those observed for other human viruses, namely HIV.

**Notes from Ng et al**

1. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC)
  - encounter viral nucleic acids via toll-like receptors (TLR) 7/9 and release type I interferons (IFN-I) that control virus infections
  - IFN-I important for activation/expansion of CD4/8 T-cells
  - Cl-13 target pDC
2. Myeloid CD8$$\alpha^{(+/-)}$$ DC
  - Cl-13 infection reduces MHC I, MHC II, and T costimulatory CD80/86/40
  - Interferes with ability to present antigen and stimulate naive T cells
3. T-cells
  - Cl-13 induces T cells to enter an attenuated state (exhausted): Loss of proliferative ability, production of antiviral and immune stimulatory cytokines, and cytolytic activity.
  - CD8+ (CTL) express inflammatory and antiviral cytokines and lyse-infected cells
    - CTL exhaustion has implicated immune-suppression pathways involving IL-10 and Programmed Death 1 (PD-1)
  - CD4+ (helper) express inflammatory cytokines, DC licensing, maintenance of CTL and B cell antibody responses. CD4 sustain CD8 function throughout infection and avert deletion of high-affinity antiviral CTL.
    - CD4 - CD8 dependence are well-established however the procesed mechanisms are unclear
4. Future
  - Currently, ongoing treatment of persistent viral infections is limited to drug targeting. Restoration of CD4 in particular is attractive as this can result in enhanced viral-specific CD8 T cells.
  - Need to known precise mechanisms of CD4 regulation and differention and their effects on CD8 and B cell compartments


**Notes from Clouthier et al. (Trends Immun. 2015; PLoS Path. 2015)**

Control of persistent infection requires a balance between antiviral immunity and immune suppression that controls infection while limiting host damage. Late control (day 60 to 90) of LCMV cl 13 is achieved by a functionally exhausted but nevertheless effective CD8 T cell respose as well as neutralizing antibodies (nAb). While pro- and anti-inflammatory are well-implicated, persistent infections also modulate expression of costimulatory members of the TNFR superfamily: 4-1 BB (TNF superfamily member 9/TNFRSF9), OX40 (TNFRSF4) and glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor family-related protein (TNFRSF18). This raises the question of what role they might play and how this knowledge might be used towards a thereapeutic effect.

1. GITR expression is transient
  - GITR on antigen-specific CD4/8 peaks at day 8 p.i. and is sustained to day 21 p.i.
  - GITRL is transient: peaks at day 2 p.i. and baseline by day 8 p.i.
2. GITR can trigger classic inflammatory pathways
  - TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) adaptors to activate NF-kappaB, MAPK and in some cases PI3K/AKT
3. GITR is important in persistent infection
  - KO reduces CD8 accumulation, increased exhaustion and impaired LCMV control
  - CD4 and IL-2 dependency promoter CD8
    - GITR is dispensible for CD4 proliferation and differentiation but required for the post-priming accumulation of antigen specific T cells including $$\text{IFN}\gamma^+\text{IL-2}^+$$ type 1 helper T (Th1) cells that facilitates CD8 T cell expansion.
  - Increased ratio of T follicular helper (Tfh) to T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells that enhance LCMV-specific B cell production of IgG.

    <strong>Figure 1. GITR Regulates CD4 T Cell Accumulation to Control Persistent LCMV Infection. </strong> This schematic shows that GITRL on an APC interacts directly with GITR on a CD4+ T cell early during infection, which in turn allows both CD4 Th1 and Tfh to accumulate. The inset shows that CD4 T cell-intrinsic GITR signals through TRAF2/5 to activate the canonical NF-kB pathway as well as AKT and mTORC1 leading to increased T cell accumulation. These signals were detected at higher levels in GITR+/+ compared to GITR /  CD4 LCMV-specific (SMARTA) T cells at day 3 post-LCMV cl 13 infection. The CD4 T cells in turn provide IL-2-dependent help to the CD8 T cells to allow increased accumulation between day 5 and 8 postinfection (p.i.) [28]. Pascutti et al. also found that CD4 T cells from GITRL-tg mice had higher expression of CD40L, which may improve help for CD8 T cells through effects on APCs [29]. GITR also impacts on the ratio of Tfh to Tfr, allowing enhanced antibody responses. The net effect is increased LCMV-specific CD8 T cells and antibodies, which allows increased viral control. GITRL is found on F4/ 80+CD11bhi myeloid cells, peaking at day 2 p.i. and is reduced to below baseline by day 8 p.i. [27]. It is not known if GITRL is presented to CD4 T cells via the priming APC or if there are serial engagements on other (or the same) APCs. However, GITR affects Th1 and Tfh cells to a similar extent, suggesting a general effect on CD4 T cell accumulation rather than on differentiation. The nature of the APC that brings the CD8 T cell and the CD4 T cell close together, or if an APC is even required for this process, is not known. Figure credit:
