## Quick Summary

## Author Profile

## Context
Genes encoding chromatin regulators are often altered in cancers and a growing body of experimental observations insicate that global epigenetic remodelling is common in oncogenesis (Dawson 2012). This evidence provides a rationale for development of drugs targeting protein regulators of chromatin state and transcription. Indeed, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved for routine clinical use several small molecule inhibitors of such proteins (Helin 2013). Functional screens represent an attractive approach (Letai 2017).

## Question
What molecular mechanisms support the growth advantage of brain tumour cells *in vivo*?     

## Goals

Gliomas account for about 30% of tumours arising in the central nervous system and nearly half of these are categorized as Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the most common and aggressive form of malignant brain tumours (Bastien 2015). Treatment for GBM involves surgery followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation, but unfortunately, less than 10% of those with aggressive GBM survive beyond five years. There have been few advancements in therapy over the past two decades. 

Large-scale characterization of the mutational landscape of GBM tumours have helped flag well-known pathways (RB, p53 and PI3K/AKT) as well as those not previously appreciated to have an association with the disease (NF-1 and IDH1) (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2008). Accordingly, therapeutics targeting PI3K, receptor tyrosine kinases or the p53 pathway represent the majority of those that have advanced to evaluation in the clinic (Bastien 2015). Unfortunately, the performance of these therapies in clinical trials has been largely disappointing, arguing that alternative therapeutic targets should be identified. 

Miller *et al.* (Miller 2017) use pathway enrichment analysis to identify transcriptional pause-release mechanism as a key dependency for the growth advantage of GBM *in vivo*.

## Approach

  Miller and colleagues set out to gain an appreciation of whether the genes that provide GBM a growth advantage include chromatin regulators. To accomplish this, they developed a screening strategy in patient-derived glioblastoma cells that targeted 406 chromatin regulator genes with short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) such that, on average, each cell would express one shRNA (Figure 1). Next, the pooled transgenic population of cells were either passaged in cell culture or patient-derived xenografts (PDX) were created by intracranial (IC) injection in mice. Following a three week growth period in each condition, the clonogenicity of cells harbouring a unique shRNA was assessed. In this case, a low count of cells with a given shRNA suggests that GBM depends on that gene for a growth advantage.  

  Using this approach the authors observed a large disparity in the number of dependencies identified: 60 for PDX cells grown *in vivo* compared to only 14 for the *in vitro* population. The most surprising and unsettling finding was that, apart from control and essential genes (RNA polymerase and DNA methyltrasferase), there was no overlap in depedencies (Figure 1).

  A problem is that a list of gene dependencies is one thing but difficult to interpret - how do these genes relate to one another and how do they impinge upon growth? What does it all mean? Two forms of enrichment analysis that were complementary aspects of creating a larger context for the growth dependencies. Overrepresentation analysis and pathway enrichement analysis.

  <strong>Figure 1. </strong> RNA knockdown screens for essential genes. Miller <em>et al.</em> took cells from patients with the cancer glioblastoma, and introduced different inhibitory RNA molecules into different cells (colour coded). Each RNA molecule inhibited expression of a gene involved in epigenetic modification â€” regulation of chemical modifications on DNA and associated proteins that alter gene activity without changing the underlying DNA sequence. The authors grew the cells in culture or in the brains of mice for two to three weeks, then analysed cell depletion, to see which genes must be properly expressed for normal glioblastoma-cell growth. The <em>in vivo</em> and <em>in vitro</em> results showed almost no overlap. Genes vital for growth <em>in vivo</em> screen related to a regulatory process in gene transcription called pause release.
