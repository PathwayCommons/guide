## Quick Summary

## Author Profile
Takatoshi Chinen and Alexander Y Rudensky are at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY. Arun K Kannan is in the immunology discovery division of Biogen in Cambridge MA.

## Context
Metastatic melanoma has a 10-year survivial rate of less than 10% and is particularly refractory to standard chemotherapy. Therapies that harness the immune system to detect and disable cancer cells have demonstrated tremendous promise with respect to specificity and efficacy. Unfortunately, most melanomas are poorly immunogenic and this has been speculated to result from lack of immune activation and tumour-driven immune suppression.

One success story is [ipilimumab (Yervoy; Bristol-Myers Squibb)](http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrd3463){: target="_blank"}, a monoclonal antibody which was approved for the treatment of melanoma in 2011. Ipilimumab acts by disrupting the built-in mechanisms that normally negatively-regulate effector immune cells. Clinical trials nearly doubled the time of patient survival in those whose disease was unresponsive to standard treatment.  Nevertheless, complications do arise with ipilimumab including various gastrointenstinal, hepatic and skin inflammation. There has been a recognition for the need to better understand mechanisms of immune reactions induced by immunotherapy, that is, how immune homeostasis is achieved (Nature Med. 2017).

## Question
One liner.

## Goals

In humans and mice, a deficit in regulatory T cells (Tregs) can lead to multiple organ-specific autoimmune diseases (refs). This is consistent with the observation that a balance between Tregs and effector T cells is dysregulated in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Despite the importance of Tregs in restraining immune responses, an understanding of the mechanisms through which Tregs act and their relative importance in different contexts remains poorly understood.

Tregs can achieve their suppressive effects on T cells through mechanisms involving direct cell-contact, such as modulating antigen presenting cell competency, as well as a variety of contact-independent means (Figure 1). IL-2 has been the focus of much research as it is essential for the development, homeostasis and function of both Tegs and effector T cells (Klatzmann 2015). In particular, the competitive sequestration of extracellular IL-2 by Tregs has long been speculated to disrupt the metabolism of effector T cells by denying them the effects of IL-2.

  <strong>Figure 1. Regulatory T cell suppression of effector T cells.</strong> A variety of molecular mechanisms might operate in a complementary fashion to contribute to TREG cell-mediated suppression. All these mechanisms can be classified into two major categories: cell-contact-independent mechanisms (production of inhibitory cytokines, deprivation of IL-2 and ATP/ADP) and cell-contact-dependent mechanisms (induction of cytolysis, modulation of APCs).

In this study, Chinen et al. (Chinen 2016) set out to dissect the precise role that the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) plays in Treg intracellular signaling and how this underlies its suppressive function towards effector T cells.

## Approach

The authors proposed three possibilities for how IL-2R might mediate its effects in differentiated (peripheral) Tregs: Homing towards self-reactive T cells which produce IL-2 ligand; Deprivation of IL-2; and intracellular signalling to support maintenance, proliferation and function via JAK-STAT5, PI3K-Akt or Ras-ERK pathways (Li 2016) (Figure 2). To define the role of IL-2R in Tregs, the authors created mice with selective ablations in IL-2Ralpha, IL-2Rbeta and STAT5 and examined cells expressing *Fox3p*, which is a classic Treg marker (Figure 1).

  <strong>Figure 2. Intracellular signalling in Tregs.</strong>. The activation of Tregs is mediated by combined signalling through the T cell receptor (TCR) and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD28, and through the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R). It is hypothesized that TReg cells have evolved to depend more heavily on signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)-dependent IL-2R signalling (thick arrow) than on TCR and CD28 signalling compared with effector T cells. <em>Adapted from Klatzmann et al., Figure 2 (Klatzmann 2015)</em>.
