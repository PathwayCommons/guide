## Context
Therapies that aim to harness the immune system to target and disable cancer cells have stoked tremendous hope and in have shown promise. One success story is [ipilimumab (Yervoy; Bristol-Myers Squibb)](http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrd3463){: target="_blank"} which was approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in 2011. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that acts by disrupting endogenous mechanisms within T cells that otherwise reduce their level of activation. In clinical trials, a significant increase in survival time could be attributed to ipilimumab for those whose disease was unresponsive to standard chemotherapy. Nevertheless, trial participants suffered complications including gastrointenstinal, hepatic and skin inflammation. These observations reinforce the call for a better understanding of immune reactions induced by immunotherapy, and more generally, how a proper balance between immune activation and inhibition is achieved (Nature Med. 2017).

## Question
What are the signaling mechanisms that immune cells use to mediate system-wide immune repression?

## Goals

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in restraining the immune system by maintaining peripheral tolerance, preventing autoimmune disorders and limiting chronic inflammation (Vignali 2008). Accordingly, quantitative deficits in Treg cells in humans and experimental mouse models leads to multiple organ-specific autoimmune diseases. This is consistent with the notion that the balance between Tregs and effector T cells (i.e. CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic) is dysregulated in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. A major challenge is to develop a comprehensive account of the mechanisms through which Tregs repress immune responses and the relative importance of each in varying contexts.

Tregs have been shown to act through mechanisms that involve direct cell-contact, such as modulating antigen presenting cell (APC) competency, as well as by modulating the extracellular milleu of effector T cells (Figure 1). Signalling by IL-2 has been the focus of much research as it is essential for the development, homeostasis and function of both Tegs and effector T cells (Klatzmann 2015) (Figure 1c).

Basic mechanisms used by Treg cells.</strong> Depiction of the various regulatory T (Treg)-cell mechanisms centred around four basic modes of action. <strong>a.</strong> Inhibitory cytokines include interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-35 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta). <strong>b.</strong> Cytolysis includes granzyme-A- and granzyme-B-dependent and perforin-dependent killing mechanisms. <strong>c.</strong> Metabolic disruption includes high-affinity CD25 (also known as IL-2 receptor alpha)-dependent cytokine-deprivation-mediated apoptosis, cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated inhibition, and CD39- and/or CD73-generated, adenosine receptor 2A (A2AR)-mediated immunosuppression. <strong>d.</strong> Targeting dendritic cells (DCs) includes mechanisms that modulate DC maturation and/or function such as lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3; also known as CD223)–MHC-class-II-mediated suppression of DC maturation, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4)–CD80/CD86-mediated induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which is an immunosuppressive molecule made by DCs.. <em>Adapted from Vignali et al., Figure 1 (Vignali 2008)</em>.

Here we describe a study by Chinen *et al.* (Chinen 2016) who dissected the IL-2 signalling pathway in Tregs in order to establish the means by which its components impact effector T cell suppression. The authors suggested at least three (not necessarily mutually exclusive) ways in which the IL-2 receptor might mediate its effects: Facilitate homing of Tregs towards self-reactive T cells which actually produce IL-2 ligand; IL-2 sequestion and deprivations; and intracellular signalling to support maintenance, proliferation and function via JAK-STAT5, PI3K-Akt or Ras-ERK pathways (Li 2016) (Figure 2).

  <strong>Figure 2. Intracellular signalling in Tregs.</strong>. The activation of Tregs is mediated by combined signalling through the T cell receptor (TCR) and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD28, and through the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R). This receptor is a complex of an alpha (CD25), beta (CD122) and a common gamma-chain (CD132) of polypeptides encoded by the genes <em>il2ra</em>, <em>il2rb</em> and <em>il2rg</em>, respectively. It is hypothesized that TReg cells have evolved to depend more heavily on signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)-dependent IL-2R signalling (thick arrow) than on TCR and CD28 signalling compared with effector T cells. <em>Adapted from Klatzmann et al., Figure 2 (Klatzmann 2015)</em>.

## Approach

IL-2 initiates signalling in Tregs by binding to the extracellular domain of the IL-2R receptor which is comprised of three polypeptide chains (Figure 2): An $$\alpha$$-chain, a $$\beta$$-chain and a common $$\gamma$$-chain. Intracellular signals are mediated through the JAK kinase which phosphorylates the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription molecule STAT5, a dimer of STAT5A and STAT5B encoded by *stat5a* and *stat5b*, respectively.

To define the role of IL-2R in Tregs, Chinen *et al.* created gene-targeted mice with ablations in either *il2ra* or *il2rb*. In order to dissect the specific role of intracellular signalling downstream of the receptor, the  authors utilized a constitutively active form of STAT5B generated by the *stat5bCA* transgene that obviated the need for upstream IL-2/JAK signals. Using a combination of these tools, the authors were able to tease out how alterations in Tregs affected effector T cell subgroups and system-wide inflammation (Figure 1).

A master regulator of Treg cells is the forkhead box 3 (*Foxp3*) gene, a member of the forkhead/winged-helix family of transcription factors (Rudensky 2011). The consensus view of *Foxp3* function is to amplify and stabilize features of Treg cells that are previously conferred by TCR and cytokine signaling, such as expression of IL-2R$$\alpha$$ and CTLA4 (Figure 2). In order to definitively establish the role of IL-2R in Treg cell function *in vivo*, the authors employed a transgenic mouse that disabled *il2ra* or *il2rb* only within cells that express *Foxp3*, that is, the Treg lineage.

As expected, deletion of either *il2ra* or *il2rb* in peripheral *Fox3p*-expressing cells resulted in an early onset of fatal autoimmune inflammatory disease and lymphoproliferation. These phenotypes were accompanied by a drastic reduction in tyrosine-phosphorylation of STAT5, which is an intracellular target of IL-2R/JAK (Figure 2). Accordingly, ablation of *stat5a* and *stat5b* in in peripheral *Fox3p*-expressing cells mimicked the autoimmune phenotype observed in IL-2R mutants. Finally, constitutive expression of *stat5b* (*stat5bCA* transgene) in an *il2ra*-deficient strains (unable to sequester IL-2) was sufficient to rescue the systemic inflammation and early fatal disease. These observations are consistent with a requirement for cell-intrinsic IL-2R signalling in Tregs.

In contrast to the rescue of the early inflammatory disease, the *stat5bCA* strain only marginally restrained expansion of CD8+ T cells in later weeks (3-12) and eventually succumb to disease suggesting a STAT5 signalling-independent mechanism of suppression. However, application of IL-2-neutralizing antibody in *il2rb*-deficient, *stat5bCA* mice at 5 - 7 days of age completely suppressed CD8+ T cell activation and proliferation. These observations support a role for Tregs in suppressing CD8+ T cells via IL-2 depletion.

Next, Chinen *et al.* turned their attention to the question of how STAT5 signaling potentiated Treg suppression. Interestingly, the authors demonstrated that constitutive *stat5b* expression did not increase suppression by augmenting the number of Tregs but rather by enhancing the suppressive ability of each cell. Coupled with this, previous work showed that increases in STAT5 at least as large as those observed with *stat5bCA* do not translate into increased genome binding of FOX3P (Arvey 2014).

To gain more insight, the authors compared gene expression between Tregs with a *stat5bCA* transgene relative to controls. Amongst ~11 000 genes analyzed, there were 342 genes upregulated and 314 downregulated in Tregs consitutively expressing *stat5b*. Analysis of signaling pathways was performed to better understand the cellular functions potentiated by activated STAT5: [BiNGO](https://www.psb.ugent.be/cbd/papers/BiNGO/Home.html){: target="_blank"} was used to identify [Gene Ontology (GO)](http://www.geneontology.org/){: target="_blank"} terms enriched in the gene expression data (10 589 genes total). The authors chose to display the enriched gene sets using an [Enrichment Map](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013984){: target="_blank"} in which gene sets are represented by nodes in a network and shared genes via edges connecting nodes. The visual nature of the Enrichment Map aids in the interpretability of enrichment analyses by providing a visual 'landscape' of the gene sets and reducing complexity by grouping redundant sets.

The enrichment analysis and Enrichment Map allowed authors to identify gene set products involved in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, cell adhesion and cell locomotion (Figure 3). This suggests that STAT5 potentiates cell interactions with target cells. Imaging studies *in vivo* are consistent with Tregs in stable interactions with dendritic cells (DC). Moreover, interaction with DCs has been shown to modulate their ability to potentiate effector T cell activation. In agreement with enrichment analyses, the *stat5bCA* transgene promoted the formation of conjugates between Tregs and DCs. This link represents a unification of two pieces of knowledge: The modulation of the ability of DCs to potentiate T cell activation and IL-2R signaling via STAT5.
