The ability to quantify the entire RNA complement of a cell is now easily within the reach of standard research laboratories. While providing an astonshing amount detail, it is often not clear how this information taken as a whole might advance understandingof the biological question at hand. What does it all mean?

<strong>The overarching purpose of this workflow is to identify and visualize pathways that are enriched in one of two biological conditions</strong>.

  <strong>Figure 1. Overview of pathway enrichment workflow (II).</strong> This workflow uses a pair-wise comparison of the underlying gene expression to infer differences in pathways between two conditions (aka 'classes' or 'states').

## <a href="#goals" name="goals">II. Goals</a>

To make the concepts in our workflow concrete, we use expression data from Best *et al.* (Best 2015) who compared blood platelets from healthy donors to those diagnosed with a malignancy towards a proof-of-principle for blood-based 'biopsies' that support cancer diagnosis.

By then end of this discussion you should (Figure 2):

We will provide a brief overview of the study and describe the methods used to generate RNA-seq profiles from platelet samples.

## <a href="#background" name="background">III. Background</a>

### Blood-based cancer biopsies

Cancer surveillance would be greatly aided by practical, low-cost alternatives to support early-detection, diagnosis, stratification and treatment decisions. Ideally these tools would be non-invasive yet retain the sensitivity and accuracy neccessary to reliably differentiate between cancerous and normal states. To this end, blood-based biomarkers have been agressively pursued as a means to diagnose malignancies. The components of blood that have been examined include both cell-free molecules (e.g. DNA, RNA, proteins) along with immune cells (monocytes, platelets) (Figure 4).

<div class="figure-legend well well-lg text-justify">
  <strong>Figure 3. Blood-based cancer biopsies.</strong> Blood can be separated into different fractions in order to enrich for tumor-associated biomarkers. From the mononuclear cell fraction, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may provide genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic information on the tumor. From plasma or serum, cell-free nucleotides and exosomes can be further used to interrogate cancer-secreted bioparticles. <em>Adapted from Joose et al. (Joose 2015), Figure 1</em>.

### A platelet primer

Within the marrow, platelets originate as cytoplasmic fragments of arrested, polyploid megakaryocytes which 'bud-off' into the circulation via shear forces generated by circulating blood. Approximately 1 trillion platelets circulate an adult human at any one time and live for an average of ten days before being sequestered by the spleen. The primary physiolocal role of platelets is to sense and accumulate at the sites of damaged endotheial tissue and initiate a blod clot to mitigate and vessel leakage (Semple 2011). Disruption of the integrity of the endothelium exposes extracellular molecules that signal adhesion of platelets to form the initial hemostatic plug. Upon activation, platelets secrete a host of molecules and proteins that recuit additional platelets and in turn, promote their activation.

The role of platelets in hemostasis has been well-studied, however, they are far from simple vestibules of biomolecules. An increasing body of research supports an active role for paletelets in modulating innate and adaptive immune responses (Semple 2011). Consequently, there is a growing appreciation that platelets actively participate in pathologies such as sepsis, atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthrtitis. In particular, the immune regulatory role of platelets arises from receptor-mediated interactions with pathogens, neutrophils and antigen-presenting cells.

Although anuclear, it has been shown that platelets are not inert and homogeneous entities. At the transcript-level, circulating platelets have been shown to possess functional splicing apparatus that is triggered in response to external activation (Denis 2005). At the protein-level, platelets possess a fully functional translation apparatus and its proteome has been described as a 'fluid' of components that rapidly alters depending on the conditions (Lindemann 2007). Thus, platelets are subject to many common aspects of gene regulation in order to sense and respond to their environment.

### Platelet 'education' in cancers

The pathogenesis of cancer requires the coopration of a host of stromal and immune cells termed the tumour microenvironment. Indeed, a variety of immune cells that normally suppress cancer are coopted by tumours to enable evasion of immune surveillance in a process termed 'education' (Quail and Joyce 2013). One mechanism of heterotypic signalling involves shedding of exomes by cancer cells containing pro-tumourigenic and pro-metastatic factors.

Platelets have been implicated in aiding and abetting the metastatic potential of cancer cells through a variety of routes (Gay 2011) (Figure 4). First, they aggregate in order to shield cancer cells that have entered the vasculature from immune cell recognition. Second, they facilitate their extravasation by enabling cancer cell to arrest and adhesion at points in the vasculature. Third, platelets secrete variety of molecules that support cancer cell survival and promote endothelial permeability, further promoting their extravasation.

<div class="figure-legend well well-lg text-justify">
  <strong>Figure 4. Molecular coordination between platelets and tumour cells supports metastasis from the bloodstream.</strong> As platelets become activated, they undergo a shape change, increase their adhesiveness, release granules and microparticles, and perpetuate the cohesion of heteroaggregates containing tumour cells, platelets and leukocytes. Platelet granules contain growth factors, chemokines and proteases. During cohesion, circulating tumour cells can interact with activated platelets and leukocytes, and form heteroaggregates that support attachment to the endothelium and thereby contribute to metastasis. During adhesion, initial, transient adhesion is followed by firm attachment that is mediated by integrins and intercellular cell adhesion molecules. During immune evasion, multivalent plasma proteins form intercellular bridges, and activated platelets and fibrinogen protect tumour cells from natural killer cell lysis during haematogenous metastasis.

(Gay 2011), Figure 2</em>.
</div>

The close contact between cancer cells and platelets results in their 'education'. For example, tumour-associated RNA (e.g. EGFRvIII in brain and  PCA3 in prostate) could be detected in platelets (Nilsson 2011) and is  consistant with observations that tumor exomes could be taken up by platelets.

### RNA-seq of tumour-educated platelets (TEM)

The evidence indicating that platelets have intimate contact with cancer cells, take up exome-derived RNA, demonstrate differential splicing in response to their environment and their abundance in blood supports the notion that they may possess a large degree of heterogeneity. Such diversity could be clinically relelvant if they enable discrimination between different stages of a maligancy. Best *et al.* set out to determine just how much diagnostic 'information' is contained in platelet transcriptomes.

#### Sample collection

Best et al. prospectively collected blood platelets from 55 healthy donors (HD) and from 189 treated and untreated patients with cancers at varying stages (Table 1). In particular, 39 of these were from breast cancers (BrCa) which will be the focus of our workflow.

![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.media_root }}{{ page.id }}/{{ page.tables.table_1 }}){: .img-responsive }


#### RNA sequencing and analysis

Figure 5 displays the overall sample collection and processing scheme. For each sample, approximately 100-500 picograms of total platelet RNA  - the equivalent content in less than a drop of blood - was extracted for RNA sequencing.

</div>

As Best *et al.* were interested in the discriminatory capacity of transcriptomes, they initially filtered RNA species for those that were intron-spanning and had sufficiently high expression counts (>5) to reduce the amount of noise.

A reduced set of 5 003 protein and non-coding RNAs (excluding Y chromosome and mitochondrial) were used in a pair-wise comparison of expression between HD and pan-cancer samples. Across all cancers the authors identified 1 453 and 793 RNAs with increased and descreased representation, respectively (Figure 5D). These differentially expressed genes were sufficient to discriminate HD and cancer-derived platelets (Figure 5E).

#### Breast cancer diagnostics

Is the information in platelets sufficiently informative to discriminate between healthy donors and those with breast cancer? To determine this, the authors first performed a clustering analysis to extract a subset of RNA species (n = 192) with discriminatory power then fed these genes into a machine learning algorithm trained to assign the correct category for each sample. In this case, the authors reported a 100% test accuracy in discriminating platelets derived from normal versus breatst cancer patients (Figure 6).

### Zooming out: Pathway analysis

That such a plentiful and accessible material could provide the basis of an astonishingly accurate classification scheme is an exciting achievment and lends support for blood-based cancer diagnostics. We can repurpose the same RNA measurements to probe deeper into the biology of the platelets themselves.

Let us revisit two points raised earlier:

  1. Platelets play an active and important role in the physiology of cancer
  2. Platelets are functional cells that modify gene expression and behaviour in repsonse to environemental stimuli

While a list of genes with exquisite discriminatory power is useful for breast cancer diagnosis, we can ask a more fundamental question: What biological processes distinguish platelets from and healthy and diseased patients? In other words, we wish to better understand how those differences in RNA species might affect the various *pathways* inside a cell. What does the transcriptomic data really *mean*?


## <a href="#workflow_step" name="workflow_step">IV. Workflow Step</a>

In this workflow step (Box 1), we will transform the RNA sequencing data counts generated by Best *et al.* for platelets from 16 HD and 16 BrCa patients into three output files that are dependencies for later steps:

  1. Rank
    - The  [RNK](http://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#RNK:_Ranked_list_file_format_.28.2A.rnk.29){:target="_blank"} file consists of tab-delimited rows with gene names and their rank calculated from differential expression testing (p-values).
  2. Expression

  3. Phenotype
    - The [CLS](http://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#CLS:_Categorical_.28e.g_tumor_vs_normal.29_class_file_format_.28.2A.cls.29){:target="_blank"} format contains information about the sample classes (aka 'condition', 'phenotype') and assigns each sample to one class.

### Input

#### Raw Data

The data for Best *et al.* (Best 2015) has been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession number [GSE68086](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68086){:target="_blank"}. The Supplementary File [GSE68086_TEP_data_matrix.txt.gz (3.8 MB)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE68086&format=file&file=GSE68086%5FTEP%5Fdata%5Fmatrix%2Etxt%2Egz) contains RNA sequencing data for all 285 patients and donors in a single file.

#### RNA-seq files and metadata

In this workflow, we will be examining only a subset of the raw data provided above: 16 BrCa and 16 HD samples. Also, *Best et al.* submitted the RNA-seq data as a single table. Since we wish to mimic typical outputs that would originate from a sequening facility, we have divided each of the 32 sample reads into its own tab-delimited file. Table 2 shows an excerpt of one RNA-seq run with a column for the gene symbol (Ensembl) and the mapped sequence read count.

> NB: There is no header for RNA-seq files.

### Analysis

The true work involved at this stage is assigning a rank to each RNA species based on some measure of differential RNA expression. Rather than provide a detailed discussion of the concerns surrounding differential expression testing, we provide a thumbnail sketch of the tasks involved in achieving this goal.

> We refer the reader to our primer on [RNA sequencing analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}/primers/functional_analysis/rna_sequencing_analysis/){:target="_blank"} for a detailed description of the theory underlying the processing steps described here.

#### 1. Data wrangling

Getting the data into the format that is useful for downstream analysis is a central but often underappreciated aspect of computational biology research. In this case, there are three tasks that we must accomplish with our data and metadata.

First, we must integrate or 'merge' the 32 RNA-seq files together into a single table. The reason for this is that data in table format is a form that is more easily loaded into RNA-seq analysis software packages.

Second, we must perform gene 'ID mapping'. This entails translating the names of genes/RNA species provided within the raw RNA-seq files into a desired namespace. This is neccessary in order for us to compare our RNA counts for a given gene with the genes that constitute candidate pathways in our enrichment step.

Third, using our metadata we can generate our [phenotype](http://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#CLS:_Categorical_.28e.g_tumor_vs_normal.29_class_file_format_.28.2A.cls.29){:target="_blank"} information (Table 4), which declares the number of samples and classes (row 1), names the classes (row 2) and then declares the class to which each sample belongs (row 3). Since our metadata contains the name (id) of the sample and the class, this is a simple task.

**Table 4. Phenotype information layout (.cls file)**

|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| 30 | 2 | 1 | |...| |
| #| HD| BrCa| |...| |
| HD | HD | HD | ...| BrCa | BrCa |


#### 2. Filtering

Biological processes are inherently noisy (Raser 2005) and the same goes for gene expression. Some of this gene expression noise arises from the probabilistic or 'stochastic' nature of biochemical reactions which are rather pronounced when dealing with small numbers of molecules.

In practical terms, RNA species with very low mapped read counts in a small number of samples can be highly variable 'just by chance'. Consequently, we choose to ignore these in the search for differential expression. Best *et al.* use the rule of thumb that 'genes with less than five (non-normalized) read counts in all samples were excluded from analyses' ('Differential expression of transcripts', [Supplemental Experimental Procedures](http://www.cell.com/cms/attachment/2040885974/2054783948/mmc1.pdf){:target="_blank"}, pp.8).

#### 3. Normalization

RNA for a sample can be sequenced to varying 'depths'. This means that the total number of sequence reads mapped to a gene for an individual sequencing run is not neccessarily constant. The reason for this lies in the nature of [next-generation sequencing technologies](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/ebi-next-generation-sequencing-practical-course). Nevertheless, what most concerns us is not the absolute counts of an individual RNA species coming out of a sequencing run but rather the proportion. In practical terms, we desire a fair-comparison of RNA counts between samples that takes into account variation in depth.

Over the years, several approaches have been proposed to account for varying depth in RNA-seq outputs (Oshlack 2010). Our recommendation is to use a normalization technique called Trimmed mean of M-values (TMM; Robinson & Oshlack 2010) that effectively standardizes counts between distinct sequencing runs by assuming that most genes are not expected to alter their expression.

At this stage, we can generate a table of normalized RNA species [expression](http://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#TXT:_Text_file_format_for_expression_dataset_.28.2A.txt.29){:target="_blank"} where row names are gene symbols and column names are sample IDs.

**Table 5. Normalized expression (counts per million mapped reads)**

| NAME | DESCRIPTION | MGH-BrCa-H92-TR472_htsqct |...|Breast-60_htsqct|
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| PPP1R2 | PPP1R2 | 20.0960199625179 | ...| 21.2351177118648|
| STARD7 | STARD7 | 9.80293656708189 |...|0|
| TDP2 | TDP2 | 35.2905716414948 |...| 89.9369691326038|
|...|
| ANAPC13 | ANAPC13 | 1.47044048506228 |...| 1.24912457128616|

#### 4. Differential expression testing

In this stage we perform a pair-wise comparison of RNA species counts in BrCa samples relative HD samples. The framework used to determine differential RNA expression is a 'hypothesis-testing' technique that entails the following:

1. Declare the null hypothesis of no difference in RNA counts for all genes betweeen classes
2. Define a null distribution that describes how RNA counts vary under circumstances where there is *no association between RNA counts and class*
3. Calculate the probability (p-value) of observing a difference in RNA species counts between classes at least as extreme as the one observed *assuming the null hypothesis/distribution*

At this stage, we can generate a list (i.e. table) of RNA species [ranked](http://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#RNK:_Ranked_list_file_format_.28.2A.rnk.29){:target="_blank"} by a function of their p-value where row names are gene symbols and a single column indicates rank. The larger the magnitude of the positive or negative rank, the rarer such an observation would be under the assumption of no association between class and RNA count.

**Table 6. A ranked gene list**
