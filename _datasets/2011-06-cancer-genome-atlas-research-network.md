### Quick Summary
* 489 high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas
* Measurement of mRNA, microRNA, promoter methylation and DNA copy number


### Author Profile
[The Cancer Genome Atlas](http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) (TCGA) is a collaboration between the [National Cancer Institute](http://www.cancer.gov/) (NCI) and the [National Human Genome Research Institute](https://www.genome.gov/) (NHGRI) that has generated comprehensive, multi-dimensional maps of the key genomic changes in 33 types of cancer. The TCGA dataset, comprising more than two petabytes of genomic data, has been made publically available, and this genomic information helps the cancer research community to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer.

### Context
The majority of deaths (~70%) from ovarian cancer are attributed to high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) (Vaughan 2011). Therapy and survival rates for ovarian cancers in general have not appreciably changed over the last 40 years:  HGSOC are treated with aggressive surgery and taxane-platinum therapy. Approximately a quarter of naive patients will relapse within a year with 80-90% showing resistance to therapy; The five-year survival rates is poor at 31%.

It is now appreciated that ovarian cancers arise in varying anatomical locations and possess modest similarity to one another with regards to epidemiology and molecular alterations. In particular, a substantial proportion of HGSOC are believed to arise in the distal fallopian tubes (Figure 1).

  <strong>Figure 1. Clinical and molecular features of HGSOC.</strong> <strong>a |</strong> Different stages of HGSOC development in the human fallopian tube marked by p53 staining and cellular morphology. A substantial proportion of HGSOC arises from the fallopian tube, most likely PAX8-positive fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells (FTSECs). p53 staining marks clonal expansion of cells (signatures) in the absence of morphological transformation of the fallopian tube epithelium. Piling up of cells and loss of epithelial architecture occurs in early lesions (tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (TIC)), finally leading to invasive cancer. *Adapted from Bowtell et al. 2011*.

Molecular characterization of HGSOC tumor samples has found a near universal (~98%) inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway (Ahmed 2010). Similarly, approximately half are defective for the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway, likely arising from alterations in *BRCA1/2*, while the remaining often contain amplifications near the *CCNE1*. Despite the common themes in alterations that accompany HGSOC, single-agent, molecularly targeted therapies have yielded but incremental benefits in the clinic. 

It is clear that one of the most pressing challenges for the management and treatment of HGSOC is a much cleaer understanding of the cellular and molecular events that underlie the genesis, progression, and resistance of this cancer to therapy.
